# Simple Redis server in Go

For those that don't know what Redis is, it's an open-source, in-memory data structure stored used as a database cache and message broker. It is known for having fast performance and supports various data types, including string, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, streams and more !

My objective is to create the same software, but simplier. Just a small lightweight version.
